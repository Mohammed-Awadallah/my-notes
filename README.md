# Mindset of a Developer 

In this report imma share with you what i learned from reading the article . 


## My Opinion.
In my opinion a developer has to have creativity and tendency for simplicity  
for him/her to be not "Basic" so to say , those who dont have the simplicity mindset tend to have very complex and not put together projects which in this day and age can be considered fatal to ones career . 
that dont mean you have to be extra simple a hint of creativity of required for you to rise above the rest .

### Important notes 
*   you have to have a mind for solving problems developers differ from programmers by this key principle.
*  Prioritizing and Maintenance is a must .

 And I cant stress this enough never seek perfection is your number 1 enemy : it can lead to various mistakes along the way of your project such as : 
-   You will be writing code that isnâ€™t needed
-   You will increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes
-   You will be too generic
-   You will be missing deadlines
-   You will be dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity
